    "Bag-of-words representation is limited in that it does not take into account word ordering and context. There are other richer and more expressive representations of text which can be extracted using transfer learning. In this lab, we will use one such representation called sentence embedding representation, which uses deep learning models to generate dense, fixed-length vector representations for sentences. We will extract such representations using sentence transformer package. Sentence embedding takes into account context of words and semantic meaning of sentences and it is likely to work better when we are interested in clustering sentences based on their semantic similarity. \n",

For example, for KMeans, you need to specify the number of clusters in advance, which is often challenging on real-world datasets. For DBSCAN, you need to pick appropriate `eps` and `min_samples`. For hierarchical clustering, you need to pick a suitable linkage criterion, distance metric, and prune the tree so that it's possible to visualize and interpret it. \n",
