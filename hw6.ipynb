    "Bag-of-words representation is limited in that it does not take into account word ordering and context. There are other richer and more expressive representations of text which can be extracted using transfer learning. In this lab, we will use one such representation called sentence embedding representation, which uses deep learning models to generate dense, fixed-length vector representations for sentences. We will extract such representations using sentence transformer package. Sentence embedding takes into account context of words and semantic meaning of sentences and it is likely to work better when we are interested in clustering sentences based on their semantic similarity. \n",

    "Now try [`DBSCAN`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html) on our toy dataset. K-Means is kind of bound to the Euclidean distance because it is based on the notion of means. With `DBSCAN` we can try different distance metrics. In the context of text data, [cosine similarities](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/metrics.html#cosine-similarity) or cosine distances tend to work well. Given vectors $u$ and $v$, the **cosine distance** between the vectors is defined as: \n",

    "In this exercise you'll cluster recipe names with some of the clustering algorithms we have seen in class. This will also involve making some attempts to pick reasonable hyperparameter values for each clustering method based on the quality of the resulting clusters. For example, for KMeans, you need to specify the number of clusters in advance, which is often challenging on real-world datasets. For DBSCAN, you need to pick appropriate `eps` and `min_samples`. For hierarchical clustering, you need to pick a suitable linkage criterion, distance metric, and prune the tree so that it's possible to visualize and interpret it. \n",

    "Here are some methods which may help you with picking reasonable values for the hyperparameters. \n",

    "- Visualize Silhouette plots. \n",
    "- Visualize resulting clusters using `plot_umap_clusters` function from Exercise 1. \n",
    "- Sample some recipes from each cluster, manually inspect whether there are coherent semantic themes. (For this, you may use the function `print_clusters` given below.) \n",

    "**Note that the process of picking reasonable hyperparameter values will be exploratory, iterative, and will involve manual inspection and judgment, as there is no ground truth to verify how well the model is doing. In your solutions, please do not include everything you try. Only present the results of the most informative trials. Add a narrative to your answer so that it's easy for the grader to follow your choices and reasoning.** "
